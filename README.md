This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required for the email functionality to work:

```env
SMTP_HOST=your-smtp-host
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-smtp-username
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-smtp-password
SMTP_FROM_NAME=Talent Hub
SMTP_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
RECIPIENT_EMAIL=recipient@yourdomain.com
```

**Important for Production:**
- Ensure all environment variables are set in your production environment
- The SMTP configuration must allow connections from your production server
- Port 587 is for TLS, port 465 is for SSL (secure connection)
- The TLS configuration uses modern encryption (SSLv3 has been removed for security)

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

**Before deploying:**
1. Set all required environment variables in your Vercel project settings
2. Verify SMTP credentials are correct
3. Test the email functionality after deployment
